build_materials.py - City Buy List craft material prices (live-ish game data)

Emits docs/data/materials.json: the buy-side price of every material referenced
by recipes.json, per royal city + Caerleon + Brecilien, from AODP (the same
public source and server as baseline.json). Rebuild alongside baseline (2x/day):
recipes.json is static game data, this is the price layer that goes stale.

Two price layers per material, per city:
  - direct  (by)   = sell_price_min: the live cheapest standing sell order.
  - avg 7d  (by7)  = volume-weighted mean of the last 7 daily history points.
  - avg 30d (by30) = same over the last 30 days.
The app lets the craft calculator price materials on any of the three (direct is
freshest, the averages are steadier but cover fewer materials - history is thin).

Materials with no order and no history anywhere (faction / bound tokens,
faction-cape blueprints) are written as null so the app shows "cost n/a", never a
guess. Quality is always 1 (resources and artefacts are single-quality).

Usage:
  python scripts/build_materials.py
  python scripts/build_materials.py --server west   # default: europe (match baseline)

    a fact rather than a hole: no avalonian shard - x.3 to x.4 has no upgrade path.
