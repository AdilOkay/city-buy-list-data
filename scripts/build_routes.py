build_routes.py - City Buy List per-city direct prices (the Routes tab price layer)

Emits docs/data/routes.json: for every id in the routesmeta.json universe, the
LIVE standing orders per (quality, city) from AODP - the one price layer no
other dataset carries (toptraded/materials only hold averages or the buy side
of a single tab's math):
  - p, t  : sell_price_min + its timestamp = what you PAY to buy it there now,
            and what you undercut to SELL it there now.
  - b, bt : buy_price_max + timestamp = instant-sell exit (fill a standing buy
            order), stored only when a buy order exists.

The Routes tab crosses these between cities: buy at A for p_A, haul, sell at B
against p_B (sell order), b_B (instant) or the 7/30d averages from
toptraded.json. Timestamps ride along so the app can show price age instead of
pretending AODP is live (it is as fresh as the last player upload, and that
honesty is the edge over tools that hide it).

Rebuild alongside baseline (2x/day). Same AODP etiquette as the sibling
builders: chunked requests, 2s pacing, per-call scoped backoff.

Output shape (cities indexed to keep the file small):
  { "cities": [...7 names...], "items": {
      "T4_ORE": {"1": {"0": [p, t], "5": [p, t, b, bt], ...}},
      ...                                  t/bt = epoch MINUTES (UTC)
  }}
